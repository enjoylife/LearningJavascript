# Graphing Library

This is a project to develop my a number of my skills. Goals I would like this to cover are related to both financial and developer skills. Creating usefull charting tools while at the same time deeping my understanding of financial chart anaylsis.

# Road To Success
 Overcoming the previously defined goals will be achieved in gradual process. First up is the challenge of creating a graph and charting Library to support the financial anaylsis. This library will be a basic set of tools that manage the flow of market anaylsis. Encompassing the flow of data from its gathering to it's eventuall manipulation for anaylsis.

## Steps

### Graph Lib.
1. Define basic graphs and the abilities that have
    * Editable 
    * Efficent
    * Customizable
    * Updatable
    * Modular
2. Create A Graphing Manger to facilitate the complex combitions of graphs and data sources
    * Numerous options
    * Multiple graphing views
    * Connecting of graphs
    * Persistent settings
    * Intermediator between data, graphs, and user
3. Define connectors and manipulators to work on the datasets
    * Data flows
    * Data abstraction
4. ... Incremental inhancements, etc

### Financial 
1. TODO
